MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as No-SQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional sachems. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc.

MongoDB is designed for scalability, high availability, and performance, with features such as automatic sharing and support for multi-document transactions. It is often used as the database component of the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js) stack.

In MongoDB, data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents, called BSON(Binary JSON) documents, that have a dynamic schema. This means that you do not need to specify the structure of  your data in advance, and you can change the structure of you data as your application evolves. MongoDB also supports indexing, ad-hoc queries, and aggregation.

MongoDB is used in a wide range of applications, including modern web applications, data lake and data warehouse architectures, and mobile and IoT applications.
